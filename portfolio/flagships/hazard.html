  <h2>Overview</h2>
  <p>
Hazard is a real-time visual system that simulates a threat monitoring interface. It changes its visuals depending on system state, using animated UI elements and color-coded alerts.

  <h3>Concept</h3>
<P>Hazard is a reactive surveillance-style interface that escalates visually as system states change depending on the viewer/user's poximity to a sensor. 
  Each state has its own visual identity, and transitions feel progressive rather than abrupt.

  <p>The system was made in TouchDesigner using a node-based structure.

<div class="detail-card" data-modal="process">
  <h3>Process</h3>
  <p>I started by defining the escalation logic first: Standby → Caution → Alert → Lockdown. Then I built a visual language around that progression. graphics and warning elements were made in After Effects and tied into a centralized state system in TD. 
    After that, it was refinement—adjusting density, animation speed, color dominance, and reorganizing the network so it stayed readable.</p>
</div>

<div class="detail-card" data-modal="constraints">
  <h3>Constraints</h3>
  <p>The biggest constraint was coding a non-blocking system so that each state could be triggered
    smoothly without a delay or interfering with other states. I solved this by restructuring the code 
    into using <code>millis</code>.
  Additionally, Each alert level had to be immediately readable without collapsing into nois, color coding needed to stay distinct while scaling intensity, and the node network had to stay modular enough to not become unmanageable. 
    Performance mattered too; high-intensity states couldn’t tank frame rate.

    <h2>Concept</h2>
    <p>
      Hazard is a proximity-driven, state-based monitoring interface that escalates 
      visually in response to physical distance. An Arduino reads proximity data and 
      sends it over serial to TouchDesigner, where a centralized state system determines
       whether the interface is in Standby, Caution, Alert, or Lockdown.
        Each state modifies color dominance, animation intensity, overlay density, 
        and intensity in real time. The escalation is threshold-based and structured, meaning the interface responds logically to distance rather than randomly shifting visuals. 
      It’s a controlled system for urgency driven by the physical world.

    <h2>Technology</h2>
    <p>
     The system operates across two layers: hardware input and real-time visual routing.

On the hardware side, an Arduino reads proximity data and processes it using a Ultrasonic sensor connected to an LED, and non-blocking timing structure built with millis. This prevents delays or frozen states that would occur with blocking functions. Sensor readings are continuously evaluated against defined thresholds without interrupting other processes.

That data is sent via serial into TouchDesigner, where it enters a node-based processing chain. The incoming values are cleaned and organized before being routed into a centralized state logic structure. Expression and logic operators determine which state is active based on proximity ranges.

Each alert state exists as a modular visual block inside TouchDesigner. These modules contain imported After Effects graphics, warning typography, and animated overlays. A switch operator selects the active state, while compositing and level operators manage final brightness and blending. Escalation is handled in After Effects, and relies on hardcoded designs.

The architecture is layered: proximity input → serial processing → state logic → visual module routing → composited output.

    <h2>Process</h2>
    <p>
      The process began with defining proximity thresholds and structuring the escalation ladder before building visuals.
       I determined how distance would map to Standby, Caution, Alert, and Lockdown, then implemented non-blocking timing in Arduino using millis 
       to ensure continuous sensor polling.

Once hardware logic was stable, I moved into TouchDesigner.
\ Serial data was imported and routed into a centralized state logic network. 
Each state was built as a modular visual block containing AE-generated assets, warning systems, and animated overlays.

After integration, refinement focused on stability and clarity. 
Threshold ranges were adjusted to prevent jitter. Transition behavior was tuned so escalation felt controlled instead of abrupt. Visual density and color dominance were balanced to maintain readability under high-intensity states. Finally, the node network was reorganized to remain modular and readable as complexity increased.

    <h2>Constraints</h2>
    <p>
      The primary technical constraint was preventing state transitions from blocking one another. Using traditional delay-based timing would freeze execution and interrupt sensor responsiveness. The solution was restructuring the Arduino logic around millis, allowing continuous proximity evaluation while maintaining smooth transitions.

Signal stability was another constraint. Proximity readings fluctuate, so thresholds had to be structured carefully to avoid flickering between states. The escalation system required clean boundaries so only one dominant state could control the interface at a time.

Visually, escalation had to scale without collapsing clarity. As the system moves toward Alert and Lockdown, color saturation and animation density increase, but typography and UI panels still need to remain legible. Red dominance, in particular, risks overpowering contrast, so intensity had to be tuned rather than maximized.
Performance also imposed limits—higher density and motion could not compromise real-time rendering.
